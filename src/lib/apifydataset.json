    "description": "The welcoming reception hall has an open fireplace and a sweeping staircase that leads to the first-floor accommodation. The ground floor reception rooms include the substantial formal drawing room, which was originally designed as a ballroom. This spectacular room features a circular nook in the corner tower and beautiful parquet flooring. There is wonderful sitting room, which features a large arched picture window to the front, and a further reception room which is currently a bright family room but could be utilised as a dining room, if required. Set off the hallway is a comfortable study and the inner hallway leads you down to a fabulous kitchen and breakfast room. This lovely living space feels very much like the ‘hub’ of the house and features bi-fold doors that open to the garden. The kitchen area itself has a bespoke range of modern fitted units that incorporate a large fridge and an Everhot range. From the breakfast area, a door leads through to the rear passage where a large walk-in larder, utility room and boot/log store rooms can be found. There are seven bedrooms on the first floor, including the stunning and rather generous principal bedroom with its en suite bathroom. Two family bathrooms are located on the first floor, as well as a useful walk-in laundry/ linen room. The second floor has a further two bedrooms and a shower room.OutsideSnoddington Manor is approached through automated wrought iron gates and down a long tree-lined driveway that culminates at the front of the house where extensive parking can be found. There are some wonderful far reaching countryside views from the house and across land belonging to the house. The formal gardens are enclosed and feature a heated swimming pool and glass summer house, and in one corner, a small copse of trees and mature bushes that attract numerous species of animals and birds; a real haven for wildlife. To the rear of the house stands the newly re-surfaced hard tennis court and beyond are 2 paddocks where a variety of livestock or horses can be kept.Set to the side of the house is an impressive Victorian stable block, which features original Victorian stalls with iron supports and railings, whilst an external staircase leads up to a significant first floor area, which is currently used as a hobbies room, although has potential to convert into a gymnasium or other leisure facility. Situated to the side of the stables is a further storage room and the garaging.Lot 2Further pasture land to the north and west of the house with access off Snoddington LaneAbout 18.94 acresLot 32 large agricultural barns and further pasture/paddock land to the north and east of the houseAbout 18.85 acresLot 4Delightful detached lodge houseAbout 0.39 acresSnoddington Manor is in a rural position just outside the Hampshire village of Shipton Bellinger. The village provides several everyday amenities, including a local shop, a village hall and a primary school, while further facilities can be accessed less than three miles away in Tidworth, including a range of shops and supermarkets. Further schooling in the area includes the outstanding-rated Bishop’s Wordsworth CofE Grammar School, the independent Salisbury Cathedral School and Farleigh School.
